This HW is made in collaboration with Kelsey Reid, Matt Sloan, Mark Toneatto, and William Xia and with Aaron D'Souza.

In Part 1, I downloaded census tract shapefiles, converted the US feet to lat and log. I then extracted Brooklyn Borough and 
used a for loop
with [i] index to iterate through the lat lon column to fine the CUSP location and the cusp building.
I then plotted map plotted it. I was able to locate the CUSP in downtown Brooklyn but not the building as a red dot.

In part 2, after many hours of downloading for many times, I kept getting the below error at the end. 
Part 2 could not be completed due to this error.
