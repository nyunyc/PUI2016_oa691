## Plot Review of oa691:

![alt text](https://github.com/SpatialUrban/PUI2016_ms9548/blob/master/HW7_ms9548/Plot_oa691.png)

#### This plot needs the fundamentals: a title, x and y labels, a caption, as well as something to identify what the color ramp to the right represents.  Without any or all of those elements, I have no idea what the is plot is representative of.  I think there are some good style elements, but, like I said, there are no words to put the story together.  I can't review past that, because without know what the function of the plot is, there is no way to critique further.
