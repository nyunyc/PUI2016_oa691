![plot_oa691] (https://github.com/connorchency/PUI2016_cc5502/blob/master/HW8_cc5502/plot_oa691.png)

**CLARITY:** *is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous?*

This plot looks a bit confusing to me. From the previous data wrangling, it looks that the author is trying to visualize the age distribution or correlation of male and female citibike riders, but the plot does not have title, and the axes "b" does not indicate what kind of variable or measurement it shows. It would be better if more information is provided to the viewers of this plot to better communicate the author's idea.

**ESTHETIC:** *beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?*

It is a beautiful graph. I like how the hexagons form the plot and I think the different brightness of green colors reflects on the difference in intensity of what the author tries to show.

**HONESTY:** *is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?*

I am not certain whether the plot deforms or clearly reproduces the data. To understand what it shows I need more information. But from the codes I guess that this hexplot is about the intensity of riders' age.
