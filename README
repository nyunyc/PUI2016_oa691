HW1: I was able to successfully merge into github repo from using bash. The merge can be seen in the repo here.

HW2: I was able to use nano .bash_profile to define the export path and set the environment variable in the bash_profile window.
  
export PUI2016=/home/cusp/oa691/PUI2016_oa691

alias pui2016='cd $PUI2016'

PWD would return 
[oa691@compute ~]$ pwd
/home/cusp/oa691

When I would enter pui2016, It would fail to set up the pwd as /home/cusp/oa691/pui2016_oa691

Note: I received help from marc toneatto's HW1.
